# Julia_Neural_Networks_bee_swap_classificaiton
Use Julia languages to do neural network for classification.

Appreciate to Kaggle, the datasets is coming from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp

When I finished downloading the photos, I found that the photos were colored. But this can be a big distraction for our classification, and we need to preprocess the photo to turn it gray.(I separate to another file separately).
